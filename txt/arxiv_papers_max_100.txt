1) Title: Enhancing MRI-Based Classification of Alzheimer's Disease with  Explainable 3D Hybrid Compact Convolutional Transformers

Authors: Arindam Majee ; Avisek Gupta ; Sourav Raha ; Swagatam Das

Summary:
  Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by progressive cognitive decline and
memory loss, presents a formidable global health challenge, underscoring the
critical importance of early and precise diagnosis for timely interventions and
enhanced patient outcomes. While MRI scans provide valuable insights into brain
structures, traditional analysis methods often struggle to discern intricate 3D
patterns crucial for AD identification. Addressing this challenge, we introduce
an alternative end-to-end deep learning model, the 3D Hybrid Compact
Convolutional Transformers 3D (HCCT). By synergistically combining
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), the 3D
HCCT adeptly captures both local features and long-range relationships within
3D MRI scans. Extensive evaluations on prominent AD benchmark dataset, ADNI,
demonstrate the 3D HCCT's superior performance, surpassing state of the art CNN
and transformer-based methods in classification accuracy. Its robust
generalization capability and interpretability marks a significant stride in AD
classification from 3D MRI scans, promising more accurate and reliable
diagnoses for improved patient care and superior clinical outcomes.

2) Title: Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostics by Adaptation of 3D Convolutional  Network

Authors: Ehsan Hosseini-Asl ; Robert Keynto ; Ayman El-Baz

Summary:
  Early diagnosis, playing an important role in preventing progress and
treating the Alzheimer\{'}s disease (AD), is based on classification of
features extracted from brain images. The features have to accurately capture
main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g.,
ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This
paper proposed to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network
(3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to
different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional
autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in
structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then
fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the
CADDementia MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our
3D-CNN outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy. Abilities of
the 3D-CNN to generalize the features learnt and adapt to other domains have
been validated on the ADNI dataset.

3) Title: Convolutional Neural Network on Semi-Regular Triangulated Meshes and its  Application to Brain Image Data

Authors: Caoqiang Liu ; Hui Ji ; Anqi Qiu

Summary:
  We developed a convolution neural network (CNN) on semi-regular triangulated
meshes whose vertices have 6 neighbours. The key blocks of the proposed CNN,
including convolution and down-sampling, are directly defined in a vertex
domain. By exploiting the ordering property of semi-regular meshes, the
convolution is defined on a vertex domain with strong motivation from the
spatial definition of classic convolution. Moreover, the down-sampling of a
semi-regular mesh embedded in a 3D Euclidean space can achieve a down-sampling
rate of 4, 16, 64, etc. We demonstrated the use of this vertex-based graph CNN
for the classification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's
disease (AD) based on 3169 MRI scans of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI). We compared the performance of the vertex-based graph CNN
with that of the spectral graph CNN.

4) Title: Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease via Multi-modality 3D Convolutional  Neural Network

Authors: Yechong Huang ; Jiahang Xu ; Yuncheng Zhou ; Tong Tong ; Xiahai Zhuang ; the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

Summary:
  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most concerned neurodegenerative
diseases. In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis attached great
significance to artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic algorithms. Among
the diverse modality imaging data, T1-weighted MRI and 18F-FDGPET are widely
researched for this task. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional
neural network (CNN) to fuse the multi-modality information including T1-MRI
and FDG-PDT images around the hippocampal area for the diagnosis of AD.
Different from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does
not require manually extracted features, and utilizes the stateof-art 3D
image-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis and prognosis of AD.
To validate the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier
with paired T1-MRI and FDG-PET images using the ADNI datasets, including 731
Normal (NL) subjects, 647 AD subjects, 441 stable MCI (sMCI) subjects and 326
progressive MCI (pMCI) subjects. We obtained the maximal accuracies of 90.10%
for NL/AD task, 87.46% for NL/pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI/pMCI task. The
proposed framework yields comparative results against state-of-the-art
approaches. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that (1)
segmentation is not a prerequisite by using CNN, (2) the hippocampal area
provides enough information to give a reference to AD diagnosis. Keywords:

5) Title: Harnessing spatial homogeneity of neuroimaging data: patch individual  filter layers for CNNs

Authors: Fabian Eitel ; Jan Philipp Albrecht ; Martin Weygandt ; Friedemann Paul ; Kerstin Ritter

Summary:
  Neuroimaging data, e.g. obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is
comparably homogeneous due to (1) the uniform structure of the brain and (2)
additional efforts to spatially normalize the data to a standard template using
linear and non-linear transformations. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in
contrast, have been specifically designed for highly heterogeneous data, such
as natural images, by sliding convolutional filters over different positions in
an image. Here, we suggest a new CNN architecture that combines the idea of
hierarchical abstraction in neural networks with a prior on the spatial
homogeneity of neuroimaging data: Whereas early layers are trained globally
using standard convolutional layers, we introduce for higher, more abstract
layers patch individual filters (PIF). By learning filters in individual image
regions (patches) without sharing weights, PIF layers can learn abstract
features faster and with fewer samples. We thoroughly evaluated PIF layers for
three different tasks and data sets, namely sex classification on UK Biobank
data, Alzheimer's disease detection on ADNI data and multiple sclerosis
detection on private hospital data. We demonstrate that CNNs using PIF layers
result in higher accuracies, especially in low sample size settings, and need
fewer training epochs for convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study which introduces a prior on brain MRI for CNN learning.

6) Title: Longitudinal Pooling & Consistency Regularization to Model Disease  Progression from MRIs

Authors: Jiahong Ouyang ; Qingyu Zhao ; Edith V Sullivan ; Adolf Pfefferbaum ; Susan F. Tapert ; Ehsan Adeli ; Kilian M Pohl

Summary:
  Many neurological diseases are characterized by gradual deterioration of
brain structure and function. Large longitudinal MRI datasets have revealed
such deterioration, in part, by applying machine and deep learning to predict
diagnosis. A popular approach is to apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
to extract informative features from each visit of the longitudinal MRI and
then use those features to classify each visit via Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs). Such modeling neglects the progressive nature of the disease, which may
result in clinically implausible classifications across visits. To avoid this
issue, we propose to combine features across visits by coupling feature
extraction with a novel longitudinal pooling layer and enforce consistency of
the classification across visits in line with disease progression. We evaluate
the proposed method on the longitudinal structural MRIs from three neuroimaging
datasets: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=404), a dataset
composed of 274 normal controls and 329 patients with Alcohol Use Disorder
(AUD), and 255 youths from the National Consortium on Alcohol and
NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). In all three experiments our method
is superior to other widely used approaches for longitudinal classification
thus making a unique contribution towards more accurate tracking of the impact
of conditions on the brain. The code is available at

7) Title: Feature robustness and sex differences in medical imaging: a case study  in MRI-based Alzheimer's disease detection

Authors: Eike Petersen ; Aasa Feragen ; Maria Luise da Costa Zemsch ; Anders Henriksen ; Oskar Eiler Wiese Christensen ; Melanie Ganz

Summary:
  Convolutional neural networks have enabled significant improvements in
medical image-based diagnosis. It is, however, increasingly clear that these
models are susceptible to performance degradation when facing spurious
correlations and dataset shift, leading, e.g., to underperformance on
underrepresented patient groups. In this paper, we compare two classification
schemes on the ADNI MRI dataset: a simple logistic regression model using
manually selected volumetric features, and a convolutional neural network
trained on 3D MRI data. We assess the robustness of the trained models in the
face of varying dataset splits, training set sex composition, and stage of
disease. In contrast to earlier work in other imaging modalities, we do not
observe a clear pattern of improved model performance for the majority group in
the training dataset. Instead, while logistic regression is fully robust to
dataset composition, we find that CNN performance is generally improved for
both male and female subjects when including more female subjects in the
training dataset. We hypothesize that this might be due to inherent differences
in the pathology of the two sexes. Moreover, in our analysis, the logistic
regression model outperforms the 3D CNN, emphasizing the utility of manual
feature specification based on prior knowledge, and the need for more robust
automatic feature selection.

Summary:
  This work validates the generalizability of MRI-based classification of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and controls (CN) to an external data set and
to the task of prediction of conversion to AD in individuals with mild
cognitive impairment (MCI). We used a conventional support vector machine (SVM)
and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach based on structural MRI
scans that underwent either minimal pre-processing or more extensive
pre-processing into modulated gray matter (GM) maps. Classifiers were optimized
and evaluated using cross-validation in the ADNI (334 AD, 520 CN). Trained
classifiers were subsequently applied to predict conversion to AD in ADNI MCI
patients (231 converters, 628 non-converters) and in the independent Health-RI
Parelsnoer data set. From this multi-center study representing a tertiary
memory clinic population, we included 199 AD patients, 139 participants with
subjective cognitive decline, 48 MCI patients converting to dementia, and 91
MCI patients who did not convert to dementia. AD-CN classification based on
modulated GM maps resulted in a similar AUC for SVM (0.940) and CNN (0.933).
Application to conversion prediction in MCI yielded significantly higher
performance for SVM (0.756) than for CNN (0.742). In external validation,
performance was slightly decreased. For AD-CN, it again gave similar AUCs for
SVM (0.896) and CNN (0.876). For prediction in MCI, performances decreased for
both SVM (0.665) and CNN (0.702). Both with SVM and CNN, classification based
on modulated GM maps significantly outperformed classification based on
minimally processed images. Deep and conventional classifiers performed equally
well for AD classification and their performance decreased only slightly when
applied to the external cohort. We expect that this work on external validation
contributes towards translation of machine learning to clinical practice.

9) Title: Deep Kronecker Network

Authors: Long Feng ; Guang Yang

Summary:
  We propose Deep Kronecker Network (DKN), a novel framework designed for
analyzing medical imaging data, such as MRI, fMRI, CT, etc. Medical imaging
data is different from general images in at least two aspects: i) sample size
is usually much more limited, ii) model interpretation is more of a concern
compared to outcome prediction. Due to its unique nature, general methods, such
as convolutional neural network (CNN), are difficult to be directly applied. As
such, we propose DKN, that is able to i) adapt to low sample size limitation,
ii) provide desired model interpretation, and iii) achieve the prediction power
as CNN. The DKN is general in the sense that it not only works for both matrix
and (high-order) tensor represented image data, but also could be applied to
both discrete and continuous outcomes. The DKN is built on a Kronecker product
structure and implicitly imposes a piecewise smooth property on coefficients.
Moreover, the Kronecker structure can be written into a convolutional form, so
DKN also resembles a CNN, particularly, a fully convolutional network (FCN).
Furthermore, we prove that with an alternating minimization algorithm, the
solutions of DKN are guaranteed to converge to the truth geometrically even if
the objective function is highly nonconvex. Interestingly, the DKN is also
highly connected to the tensor regression framework proposed by Zhou et al.
(2010), where a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) low-rank structure is imposed on tensor
coefficients. Finally, we conduct both classification and regression analyses
using real MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
to demonstrate the effectiveness of DKN.

10) Title: Identifying Alzheimer Disease Dementia Levels Using Machine Learning  Methods

Authors: Md Gulzar Hussain ; Ye Shiren

Summary:
  Dementia, a prevalent neurodegenerative condition, is a major manifestation
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the condition progresses from mild to severe,
it significantly impairs the individual's ability to perform daily tasks
independently, necessitating the need for timely and accurate AD
classification. Machine learning or deep learning models have emerged as
effective tools for this purpose. In this study, we suggested an approach for
classifying the four stages of dementia using RF, SVM, and CNN algorithms,
augmented with watershed segmentation for feature extraction from MRI images.
Our results reveal that SVM with watershed features achieves an impressive
accuracy of 96.25%, surpassing other classification methods. The ADNI dataset
is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, and we observed that
the inclusion of watershed segmentation contributes to the enhanced performance
of the models.

11) Title: Data Augmentation in High Dimensional Low Sample Size Setting Using a  Geometry-Based Variational Autoencoder

Authors: Clément Chadebec ; Elina Thibeau-Sutre ; Ninon Burgos ; Stéphanie Allassonnière

Summary:
  In this paper, we propose a new method to perform data augmentation in a
reliable way in the High Dimensional Low Sample Size (HDLSS) setting using a
geometry-based variational autoencoder. Our approach combines a proper latent
space modeling of the VAE seen as a Riemannian manifold with a new generation
scheme which produces more meaningful samples especially in the context of
small data sets. The proposed method is tested through a wide experimental
study where its robustness to data sets, classifiers and training samples size
is stressed. It is also validated on a medical imaging classification task on
the challenging ADNI database where a small number of 3D brain MRIs are
considered and augmented using the proposed VAE framework. In each case, the
proposed method allows for a significant and reliable gain in the
classification metrics. For instance, balanced accuracy jumps from 66.3% to
74.3% for a state-of-the-art CNN classifier trained with 50 MRIs of cognitively
normal (CN) and 50 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and from 77.7% to 86.3% when
trained with 243 CN and 210 AD while improving greatly sensitivity and
specificity metrics.

12) Title: The effect of data augmentation and 3D-CNN depth on Alzheimer's Disease  detection

Authors: Rosanna Turrisi ; Alessandro Verri ; Annalisa Barla

Summary:
  Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach in healthcare,
outperforming traditional statistical techniques. However, to establish ML as a
reliable tool in clinical practice, adherence to best practices regarding data
handling, experimental design, and model evaluation is crucial. This work
summarizes and strictly observes such practices to ensure reproducible and
reliable ML. Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection,
which serves as a paradigmatic example of challenging problem in healthcare. We
investigate the impact of different data augmentation techniques and model
complexity on the overall performance. We consider MRI data from ADNI dataset
to address a classification problem employing 3D Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). The experiments are designed to compensate for data scarcity and initial
random parameters by utilizing cross-validation and multiple training trials.
Within this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three
different data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures,
each varying in the number of convolutional layers. Specifically, the
augmentation strategies are based on affine transformations, such as zoom,
shift, and rotation, applied concurrently or separately. The combined effect of
data augmentation and model complexity leads to a variation in prediction
performance up to 10% of accuracy. When affine transformation are applied
separately, the model is more accurate, independently from the adopted
architecture. For all strategies, the model accuracy followed a concave
behavior at increasing number of convolutional layers, peaking at an
intermediate value of layers. The best model (8 CL, (B)) is the most stable
across cross-validation folds and training trials, reaching excellent
performance both on the testing set and on an external test set.

13) Title: Structure-focused Neurodegeneration Convolutional Neural Network for  Modeling and Classification of Alzheimer's Disease

Authors: Simisola Odimayo ; Chollette C. Olisah ; Khadija Mohammed

Summary:
  Alzheimer's disease (AD), the predominant form of dementia, poses a growing
global challenge and underscores the urgency of accurate and early diagnosis.
The clinical technique radiologists adopt for distinguishing between mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD using Machine Resonance Imaging (MRI)
encounter hurdles because they are not consistent and reliable. Machine
learning has been shown to offer promise for early AD diagnosis. However,
existing models focused on focal fine-grain features without considerations to
focal structural features that give off information on neurodegeneration of the
brain cerebral cortex. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning (ML)
framework that integrates Gamma correction, an image enhancement technique, and
includes a structure-focused neurodegeneration convolutional neural network
(CNN) architecture called SNeurodCNN for discriminating between AD and MCI. The
ML framework leverages the mid-sagittal and para-sagittal brain image
viewpoints of the structure-focused Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) dataset. Through experiments, our proposed machine learning framework
shows exceptional performance. The parasagittal viewpoint set achieves 97.8%
accuracy, with 97.0% specificity and 98.5% sensitivity. The midsagittal
viewpoint is shown to present deeper insights into the structural brain changes
given the increase in accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, which are 98.1%
97.2%, and 99.0%, respectively. Using GradCAM technique, we show that our
proposed model is capable of capturing the structural dynamics of MCI and AD
which exist about the frontal lobe, occipital lobe, cerebellum, and parietal
lobe. Therefore, our model itself as a potential brain structural change
Digi-Biomarker for early diagnosis of AD.
